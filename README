Block Admin
===========

This project is now hosted at http://drupal.org/project/blockadmin .

Drupal's core admin/build/block does not scale. Beyond around 15-20 blocks,
the list is well over a page long, and it can be hard to work out what 
blocks should go where. By 50 blocks, the UI has become unuseable.

This module takes a step towards making the admin/build/block page scale 
for 20-100 blocks, by adding a filter to only display blocks added by any 
given module specified by the user. This allows the user to at least move
the block to the right region, then submit (or reveal all blocks) and then
fine-tune the sorting.

It works in the browser with Javascript but also degrades nicely if
Javascript is not available.
